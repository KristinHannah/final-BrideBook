## Bride Book

This is an App where you can keep track of your potential wedding vendors. You can tack their availability, quotes, location and name. You can also indicate when you have hired them. 

#Description

Bride Book is a react and JSX front end, and Rails backend web application created to help you track your wedding vendors. 
In the web app you can:

1. Add vendor types you are looking at (photographers, caterers, photobooths)
2. Add potential vendors of each type including details you've gathered.   
2. Indicate which you have hired
3. Delete vendors you decided not to go with 

#Install Instructions
Clone this repo and the backend repo. In the backend run "bundle install", and then run 'rails s' to get the backend running. For the front end run "npm install", and "npm start". The page should open up in your browser, and route to "/vendor_types".
